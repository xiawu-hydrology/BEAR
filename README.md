# BEAR (Bayesian error analysis with reordering)
Identifying the time series of data error during the model calibration

% BEAR Algorithm Overview: 
1) During the estimation of model parameters, a random sequence of output data errors is generated based on the probability distribution functions (PDF) of the output data error (prior knowledge). 
2) The order of this sequence is updated using residual information. 
3) By adjusting their orders, a new sequence of output data errors is obtained.
